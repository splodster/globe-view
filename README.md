# NASA SPACE APPS CHALLENGE

## CHALLENGE

The challenge is 'UNSDGs in the classroom'

Objectives:

- Develop a lesson plan that educates students about an SDG
- Develop new and exciting methods to educate students in ways that organically
align with the classroom
- Important to incorporate material that can help students realise the SDG
and measure progress made

## OUR SOLUTION

### LESSON PLAN

Context: A geography class on climate vulnerable regions

Lesson Objectives

- Identify climate vulnerable regions
- Analyse variable data to associate causes and draw its effects
- Explore climate information and make informed decisions
- Understand global climate change and its impact (UNSDG 13)

Lesson Duration: 60 Minutes

### Lesson Outline

#### INTRODUCTION - 100 mins

- Teacher goes through types of regions that are vulnerable to climate
- i.e SIDS, Arctic, Sub-Saharan Africa, Coastal/Low-lying Areas, Amazon,
Glaciers, Coral Reefs

##### SIDS

> *Small Island Developing States* (SIDS), i.e Maldives, Tuvalu
> Vulnerable to rising sea levels, coastal erosion, leading to
> agricultural harm and destruction of human settlements

##### ARCTIC

> Arctic Region, which is warming at the twice the global average,
> will disrupt ecosystems and global sea levels due to the rapid melting
> of sea ice and permafrost.

##### COASTAL/LOW-LYING AREAS

> Coastal cities are extremely vulnerable to sea-level rise, storm surges
> and flooding. A higher population density further propagates the risks,
> affecting infrastructure and economies.

##### AMAZON

> Deforestation, drought and wildfires are becoming increasingly frequent,
> affecting the ecosystem negatively.

##### ANDEAN REGION

> Rapid melting of glaciers threaten water supplies who rely on glacier-fed
> rivers for drinking water, irrigation and hydroelectric power.

#### CASE STUDIES - 20 Minutes

- Conduct research on the internet in groups for climate events that had
a negative impact on climate-vulnerable regions
- Present your findings in a short summary

##### CASE STUDY OF TUVALU

> ## Statistics
>
> Land Area: 26 Square Kilometers
> Highest Elevation Above Sea Level: 4.6 Meters
> Sea Level Rise Rate: 4 Millimeters Per Year, higher than global average
>
> ### What is happening?
>
> By 2100, at the current rate of sea level rise, Tuvalu is likely to lose
> 10-15% of its land. This leads to coastal erosion, loss of arable land and
> destruction to infrastructure. (1m rise in sea levels)
>
> Tuvalu is also at storm weather's mercy, as flooding significantly affects
> infrastructure and produces long-term challenges in rebuilding it
> (2015 Cyclone Pam)
>
> Displacement of the population may become necessary, as the island becomes
> uninhabitable. Even a 2°C increase in global temperature will accelerate
> loss of land and make Tuvalu **completely** uninhabitable by 2050
>
> Tuvalu is also prone to freshwater scarcity, droughts and loss of biodiversity
>
> ### What are they doing to combat it?
>
> There are National Adaptation Programs, targeted at improving coastal defences,
> building freshwater supply, and enhancing early warning systems for extreme
> weather events. The government is also vocal advocate for global climate
> negotiations, pushing for climate action to limit temperature rise 1.5°C above
> pre-industrial levels. There is also a migration strategy, to allow Tuavaluans
> to relocate to neighboring countries, while preserving their culture

#### INTERACTIVE GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION MAP - 20 Minutes

- Student use the interactive globe tool to learn more about how global climate
effects affect vulnerable regions
- Understand that climate change is a global effort, and climate consequences are
extreme

#### MAKING A MITIGATION PLAN - 40 Minutes

- Students in groups can collectively write a plan using *Bloom's Taxonomy* to
prepare a plan, calling their fellows to action with evidence and reasoning
- Conduct this session in 2 parts, a 20 minute session to brainstorm and
the remaining time to format and document their findings in a comprehensive
document.
- Ensure that students are knowledgeable and keen to participate in climate action
